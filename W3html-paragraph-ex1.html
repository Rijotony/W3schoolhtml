<p>This is a paragraph.
<p>Don't forget to close your HTML tags!</p>
<!--Most browsers will display HTML correctly even if you forget the end tag:
The example above will work in most browsers, but do not rely on it. -->
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks</p>
<!--The HTML <br> element defines a line break, without starting a new paragraph: The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag. -->
<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored:</p>

<p>

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

</p>
<p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

<!--The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks -->
